"""stdin/stdout glue for Claude Code's PreToolUse/PostToolUse hooks.

Reads the JSON Claude Code sends on stdin (see
https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks), snapshots/diffs the
tool's declared file (Edit, Write) or working directory (Bash), and writes
one Providence-conformant receipt per tool call to `.custody/receipts/`.

Never blocks a tool call: no `permissionDecision` is ever emitted, and this
always exits 0. This is a witness, not a gate -- the same non-blocking
posture `receipt` itself has (it judges a command after the fact, it
doesn't stop one from running).
